In this project I have performed data anlaysis on "Port Shipment Dataset" from kaggle.

It provides valuable insights into various aspects of the shipping industry. The visualizations highlight the count of products by country of destination, value of shipping by destination port, and the top and least shipped products. Additionally, the project identifies the top products by volume and weight, showcasing the most significant contributors to the shipping industry. The table summarizing product names, volume, weight, and count offers a comprehensive overview. These findings can help stakeholders in making informed decisions and optimizing their operations for greater efficiency.
